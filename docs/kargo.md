# Promotion with Kargo

Kargo promotes pulse-api through internal → stg → prod. Each environment runs
**one** pulse-api (`pulse-api-<stage>`, namespace `pulse-api`, port 30080).
Kargo deploys a build there, then runs that build's Playwright tests against
**that deployment**, and only a build that passed may move to the next stage.

Kargo UI: **https://localhost:9001** (`admin` / `123`).

## How it works

```
pulse-api push → GitHub Actions builds + pushes
                   pulse-api:sha-abc1234       (the app)
                   pulse-api-e2e:sha-abc1234   (its Playwright tests)
                      │
Warehouse (polls GHCR every 5m) → Freight = that matching pair
                      │
Stage internal: deploy pulse-api-internal → run tests against http://k3s-internal:30080 → pass
                      │
Stage stg:      deploy pulse-api-stg      → run tests against http://k3s-stg:30080      → pass
                      │
Stage prod:     deploy → run tests against http://k3s-prod:30080
```

"Deploy" is: commit the new digest to `apps/pulse-api/overlays/<stage>`, push,
and sync the Argo CD app to exactly that commit. The tests run as a Job on
management (Argo Rollouts' analysis); exit 0 marks the build verified in that
stage. Nothing else is deployed for testing.

Kargo, cert-manager and Argo Rollouts are installed by Argo CD
(`argocd/kargo/install.yaml`), not by Compose. Only Rollouts' analysis
controller is used. pulse-api stays a plain Deployment.

## Layout: written once, one file per app

```
kargo/
  shared/                        # every app uses these, cluster-wide
    promote-kustomize-app.yaml   #   ClusterPromotionTask: set digest, commit, push, argocd-update
    e2e-basic.yaml               #   ClusterAnalysisTemplate: small pod (bash/curl tests)
    e2e-playwright.yaml          #   ClusterAnalysisTemplate: 1Gi+, /dev/shm, longer deadline
  chart/                         # renders one app's Project, Warehouse, Stages
  apps/
    pulse-api.yaml               # the only per-app Kargo config
```

| Argo CD (`argocd/`)                 | Creates                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kargo/shared.yaml`                 | `kargo/shared/` on management                             |
| `kargo/apps.yaml`                   | `kargo-<project>`: one chart instance per app file        |
| `appsets/kargo-apps-workloads.yaml` | `<app>-<stage>`: every app file × every workload cluster, with the `authorized-stage` annotation Kargo needs |

The git credential is shared too: it lives in `kargo-shared-resources`,
which every Kargo Project falls back to.

## Adding an app

1. Its manifests: `apps/<app>/base` + `overlays/<stage>`.
2. Its namespace on each cluster: `manifests/<cluster>/`, and an AppProject
   that allows it.
3. Its CI pushes `<image>:sha-*` and `<image>-e2e:sha-*`.
4. `kargo/apps/<app>.yaml`:

```yaml
project: orders                      # Kargo Project (namespace on management)
app: orders-api                      # apps/<app>/, Argo CD apps <app>-<stage>, namespace
argocdProject: orders
image: ghcr.io/glexposito/orders-api
e2eImage: ghcr.io/glexposito/orders-api-e2e
port: 30082
verification: [e2e-basic]
```

Every option and default: `kargo/chart/values.yaml`.

## Choosing how an app is tested

How the tests run is the e2e image's business: its entrypoint takes the
base URL and exits 0 when everything passes. Bash, Playwright and `dotnet
test` are all just different images. What the app file picks is the pod
the image runs in:

```yaml
verification: [e2e-playwright]          # one list for every stage

verification:                           # or per stage - all listed must pass
  internal: [e2e-basic]
  stg: [e2e-basic, e2e-playwright]
  prod: [e2e-basic]                     # a stage left out isn't verified
```

A new kind of test (load tests, a Prometheus error-rate check) is a new
template in `kargo/shared/`. An app with a one-off need can have its own
AnalysisTemplate in its Project namespace instead.

pulse-api's tests are in pulse-api's `e2e/`. Results are in the Job's logs.
There's no artifact storage, so Playwright's HTML reports and traces aren't
kept.

## Setup (once, GitHub profile)

Kargo needs two things before it can promote anything. Both are one-off.

### 1. A git key, so Kargo can push promotions

Every promotion is a commit to this repo, so Kargo needs write access to it.
It gets that from an SSH **deploy key**: a key pair whose public half GitHub
accepts for this repo only, and whose private half Kargo holds. The private
half never goes in git. It lives in `cluster/secrets/` (gitignored, apart from
`.gitkeep`), and `cluster/bootstrap.sh` copies it into the cluster as a
Secret in `kargo-shared-resources`, which every Kargo Project can use.

Without it, every promotion fails at its first step:

```
error cloning git@github.com:glexposito/local-gitops-promotion-lab.git ... Could not read from remote repository.
```

**a. Create the key pair** (from `cluster/`):

```bash
cd cluster
ssh-keygen -q -t ed25519 -N "" -f secrets/kargo-git-key -C kargo
```

This writes `secrets/kargo-git-key` (private) and
`secrets/kargo-git-key.pub` (public).

**b. Give GitHub the public half**, with write access:

```bash
gh repo deploy-key add secrets/kargo-git-key.pub -R glexposito/local-gitops-promotion-lab --allow-write -t kargo
```

Or in the browser: <https://github.com/glexposito/local-gitops-promotion-lab/settings/keys/new>,
title `kargo`, paste the output of `cat secrets/kargo-git-key.pub`, tick
**Allow write access**, **Add key**.

Then delete the public half; GitHub has it now:

```bash
rm secrets/kargo-git-key.pub
```

**c. Give Kargo the private half** by rerunning the bootstrap:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate argocd-bootstrap
docker logs -f argocd-bootstrap      # Ctrl+C once it prints "Managed clusters: ..."
```

The log should say `Adding Kargo's shared git credential...` and must **not**
say `No cluster/secrets/kargo-git-key`. To double-check:

```bash
docker exec k3s-management kubectl -n kargo-shared-resources get secret gitops-poc-git
```

**d. Retry anything that already failed.** Promotions that ran before the
key existed stay failed. In the Kargo UI, click the truck icon (Promote) on
**internal** and pick the newest Freight.

On a new machine, or after `docker compose down -v`, only step **c** is
needed again - as long as `secrets/kargo-git-key` is still there. Lost the
file? Delete the old `kargo` key in the repo's Settings → Deploy keys and
start again from **a**.

### 2. Public images, so Kargo can see new builds

The Warehouse reads GHCR without credentials, so both images must be public.
`pulse-api` already is. GitHub creates new packages as private, so after
pulse-api's first build pushes `pulse-api-e2e`: GitHub → your profile →
**Packages** → `pulse-api-e2e` → **Package settings** → **Change visibility**
→ **Public**. Once only.

Without it, the Warehouse finds no matching pair and creates no Freight.

## Try it

1. Push to pulse-api `main`. Within a few minutes a new Freight appears in
   the Kargo UI and goes through internal, stg, and prod on its own.
2. Each promotion is a `pulse-api: promote sha-… to <stage>` commit here.

On a fresh cluster the `pulse-api-*` apps show Missing/OutOfSync until their
first promotion: auto-sync is off, so only Kargo deploys them.

```bash
# What's running where
docker exec k3s-management kubectl -n pulse-api get freight,stages
# E2E logs of the latest verification
docker exec k3s-management kubectl -n pulse-api get jobs
docker exec k3s-management kubectl -n pulse-api logs job/<name>
# pulse-api on prod
curl localhost:8083/hostname
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| No Freight | Both images need a matching `sha-*` tag, and `pulse-api-e2e` must be public: [Setup step 2](#2-public-images-so-kargo-can-see-new-builds). Click **Refresh** on the Warehouse to check now instead of waiting 5 minutes. |
| `kargo` app keeps retrying | Normal on a fresh cluster until cert-manager is up |
| `kargo-shared` / `kargo-<project>` retrying | Normal until Kargo's and Rollouts' CRDs exist |
| Promotion fails at the first step: `error cloning ... Could not read from remote repository` | Kargo has no git key: [Setup step 1](#1-a-git-key-so-kargo-can-push-promotions), then retry the promotion |
| Promotion fails at `git-push` (permission denied) | The deploy key was added without **Allow write access**: delete it and add it again with write access |
| `argocd-update` not authorized | The Application needs `kargo.akuity.io/authorized-stage: <project>:<stage>` (`argocd/appsets/kargo-apps-workloads.yaml`) |
| Verification fails | Read the Job's logs: Playwright's `list` output, one line per test |
| Playwright Job OOMKilled | Raise memory in `kargo/shared/e2e-playwright.yaml` |
